# CDDA: Louisville
A mod that adds a new challenge mode. It has the same starting settings as the vanilla CDDA mode. However, instead of spawning in northern Muldragh, you spawn in one of 5 random spawns in Louisville.

## Features
- Five different spawn points in Louisville for variety
- Creating additional a new character after death now results in a new spawn location (maybe) and another fire so you don't have to create a new save file for each try.

## Additional Notes
Interested in playing the CDDA mode elsewhere? Check out my CDDA: Anywhere mod! It's my sequel to this mod that allows you to select your spawn, including spawn points added by other mods.
